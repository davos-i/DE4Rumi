```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(DE4Rumi)
#> Loading required package: S4Vectors
#> Loading required package: stats4
#> Loading required package: BiocGenerics
#> Loading required package: parallel
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'BiocGenerics'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:parallel':
#> 
#>     clusterApply, clusterApplyLB, clusterCall, clusterEvalQ,
#>     clusterExport, clusterMap, parApply, parCapply, parLapply,
#>     parLapplyLB, parRapply, parSapply, parSapplyLB
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     IQR, mad, sd, var, xtabs
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     anyDuplicated, append, as.data.frame, basename, cbind, colnames,
#>     dirname, do.call, duplicated, eval, evalq, Filter, Find, get, grep,
